# Data Visualisation: Do the Audio Features of Top Songs by Over the Past Decade Exhibit Consistent Patterns?

# Overview 
The purpose of this project is to analyse the audio features of top songs by popular global artists and investigate if there is a correlation between these features and their popularity. While there may be some commonalities among the audio features of top songs by popular global artists, it is unlikely that all songs will sound the same. Different artists have unique styles and preferences, which can be reflected in the audio features of their songs. However, it is possible to identify certain trends or characteristics that contribute to the popularity of these songs.
